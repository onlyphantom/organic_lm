# Predicting organic installs multiplier
This exercise is motivated by a request from an industry friend, who is interested to learn the **organic multiplier** rate for mobile app campaigns in the Shopping category in an unspecified geo / country. 

# Challenge
Given a month's worth of data, we aim to establish a model that would allow us to predict future organic installs based on the amount of paid installs we spend on acquisition each day. We use a simple linear regression model to achieve this and visualize it using ggplot.


## Pre-requisite and Dependencies

1. `ggplot2` - Data visualization based on the grammar of graphics. [A ggplot2 cheatsheet, also by me](https://github.com/onlyphantom/ggplot2cheatsheet)  


# Project structure
The project is completed using R notebook, and exported to both HTML and PDF. All three files (Rmd, HTML and PDF) are available in this repo.
